# Dwarfipelago — Lua ↔ Python Interface Reference

This document describes how the Python AP client (`DwarfFortressClient.py`) communicates
with the Lua mod running inside DFHack. It is intended as a quick reference for Python-side
development — you should not need to read through the Lua source to use this.

---

## How it works

The Lua mod runs inside DFHack and has no direct network access. All communication
happens through **DFHack's world-level persistent storage** — a key/value store that
survives save/reload cycles.

- **Lua writes** event queues and state flags as JSON strings.
- **Python reads** them via `DFHackConnection.run_command("lua", ...)` RPC calls.
- Queues follow a **pop pattern**: read the value, then immediately write `"[]"` back to clear it.
- State flags follow a **peek pattern**: read without clearing.

The Python client polls DFHack every `_poll_interval` seconds (default 5s). All
persistent storage operations require an active loaded world — the client already
guards against this with the `_world_loaded` flag.

---

## Persistent Storage Keys

All keys are namespaced under `dwarfipelago/`.

### Event Queues (pop to consume)

| Key | Format | Written by | Description |
|-----|--------|------------|-------------|
| `dwarfipelago/pending_checks` | JSON `int[]` | Lua | AP location IDs ready to send to the server |
| `dwarfipelago/pending_item_created` | JSON `ItemEvent[]` | Lua | Items created since last poll (see schema below) |
| `dwarfipelago/pending_item_stockpiled` | JSON `ItemEvent[]` | Lua | Items placed into a stockpile since last poll |

### State Flags (peek, do not clear)

| Key | Format | Written by | Description |
|-----|--------|------------|-------------|
| `dwarfipelago/checked_locations` | JSON `{id: true}` | Lua | Location IDs already checked (dedup set) |
| `dwarfipelago/goal_complete` | `"1"` or `""` | Lua | Set when the fortress has met its win condition |
| `dwarfipelago/death_count` | Integer string | Lua | Cumulative citizen deaths |
| `dwarfipelago/deathlinks_sent` | Integer string | Lua | DeathLink bounces Python has already sent |
| `dwarfipelago/pending_recv` | Integer string | Lua | Incoming DeathLinks not yet applied in-game |
| `dwarfipelago/prod/<flag>` | `"1"` or absent | Lua | Set when a first-production milestone fires |

| `dwarfipelago/blueprint/<name>` | `"1"` or absent | Lua | Set when a blueprint item has been received |
| `dwarfipelago/unlock/wealth_coffers` | Integer string | Lua | How many Merchant's Coffers received (0–5); gates wealth tier checks. Coffers also cap coin minting / gem cutting, but **only when `goal` is `"1"` (legendary_wealth)** — under other goals minting/cutting is never blocked |
| `dwarfipelago/unlock/immigration_waves` | Integer string | Lua | How many Immigration Waves received (0–5); gates title/population checks |
| `dwarfipelago/unlock/baron_charter` | `"1"` or absent | Lua | Set when Baron's Charter received; gates Baron Appointed check |
| `dwarfipelago/unlock/count_charter` | `"1"` or absent | Lua | Set when Count's Charter received; gates Count Appointed check |

| `dwarfipelago/mining/magma` | `"1"` or absent | Lua | Set when the magma sea is reached |
| `dwarfipelago/mining/circus` | `"1"` or absent | Lua | Set when the Circus (underworld) is breached |
| `dwarfipelago/farming/crop_count` | Integer string | Lua | Cumulative harvested crops (harvest milestones) |

### Config (written by Python, read by Lua)

| Key | Format | Written by | Description |
|-----|--------|------------|-------------|
| `dwarfipelago/goal` | `"0"`–`"4"` | Python | Goal type from slot data (0=slay_megabeast, 1=legendary_wealth, 2=population_boom, 3=mountainhome, 4=king_remains) |
| `dwarfipelago/wealth_goal` | Integer string | Python | Wealth target for legendary_wealth goal |
| `dwarfipelago/pop_goal` | Integer string | Python | Population target for population_boom goal |
| `dwarfipelago/king_remains_goal` | Integer string | Python | Number of Remains of the Great King required for the king_remains goal |
| `dwarfipelago/crafting_permits` | `"0"`, `"1"`, or `"2"` | Python | Crafting Permits mode: 0=off, 1=on (start with a basic set), 2=all. When non-zero, Lua cancels jobs for items whose `craftlock/<flag>` is not set |
| `dwarfipelago/energy_enabled` | `"0"` or `"1"` | Python | Whether Energy Link is enabled for this slot |
| `dwarfipelago/energy_link` | Integer string | Python | Current shared energy pool balance (kJ) available to spend; read by Lua to price/approve an early caravan |
| `dwarfipelago/caravan_energy_cost` | Integer string | Lua | Energy cost (kJ) of a requested early caravan, for Python to deduct from the pool |
| `dwarfipelago/request_caravan` | `"1"` or `"0"` | Lua | Set to `"1"` when the player requests an early caravan; Python deducts the cost and responds |
| `dwarfipelago/spawn_caravan_approved` | `"1"` or `"0"` | Python | Python sets `"1"` once the energy cost is deducted; Lua spawns the caravan then clears it |
| `dwarfipelago/ap_caravan_active` | `"1"` or `"0"` | Lua | Tracks whether an AP-summoned caravan is currently present (prevents stacking requests) |
| `dwarfipelago/energy_deposit` | Integer string | Lua | Energy (joules) the player has deposited (ale/food/coins) awaiting send to the pool; Python reads and clears |
| `dwarfipelago/use_energy_link` | `"Y"` or absent | Lua | Set when a deposit has occurred, signalling Python to process `energy_deposit` |
| `dwarfipelago/deathlink_threshold` | Integer string | Python | Dwarves (or % of pop) per DeathLink send/receive; option max is 50 |
| `dwarfipelago/deathlink_percentage` | `"0"` or `"1"` | Python | When `"1"`, threshold is treated as % of current population instead of a flat count |
| `dwarfipelago/seed` | Integer string | Python | World identity — used to scope AP storage keys and detect wrong-world loads |
| `dwarfipelago/received_index` | Integer string | Python | Count of received AP items already applied in-game; restored on reconnect so items aren't re-delivered (and counter-based progression items aren't double-counted) |
| `dwarfipelago/version` | Version string | Lua | Mod version recorded on `start()` |
| `dwarfipelago/craftsanity_enabled` | `"0"`, `"1"`, or `"2"` | Python | Craftsanity mode: 0=off, 1=on (crafted), 2=storage |
| `dwarfipelago/craftsanity_materials` | `"0"` or `"1"` | Python | When `"1"`, craft counts are split by material type (e.g. `barrel_wood` vs `barrel_metal`) |

## Data Schemas

### ItemEvent
Produced by the `onItemCreated` eventful hook and by `StoreItemInStockpile` job detection inside `onJobCompleted`.

```json
{
  "id":       12345,
  "type":     "WEAPON",
  "material": "inorganic/IRON",
  "quality":  3,
  "artifact": false,

  // stockpile events only:
  "stockpile_name":   "Weapon Pile",
  "stockpile_number": 2
}
```

`quality` values: `0`=normal, `1`=well-crafted, `2`=finely, `3`=superior, `4`=exceptional, `5`=masterwork

`type` is the `df.item_type` enum name: `WEAPON`, `ARMOR`, `FOOD`, `DRINK`, `FURNITURE`, `TOOL`, `GEM`, `CLOTH`, `CRAFTS`, etc.

`material` is the `matinfo:toString()` format: `"inorganic/IRON"`, `"plant/OAK"`, `"creature/DWARF/SKIN"`, etc.

Skipped types (never queued): `CORPSE`, `CORPSEPIECE`, `REMAINS`, `VERMIN`, `PLANT`, `PLANT_GROWTH`, `FISH_RAW`, `BODY_PARTS`

Queue is capped at 500 entries — if Python falls behind, oldest events are dropped.

### Craft Counts
Lua increments a counter in `dwarfipelago/craft_count/<flag>` each time a matching
job completes. Python polls these counters and is responsible for deciding when a
threshold is met and sending the location check to the AP server.

Read a count with `dfhack.persistent.getWorldDataString("dwarfipelago/craft_count/<flag>")` —
returns an integer string.

Initialized by Python to create the persistent storage for Lua to count the crafts to.
Example:

Flag keys are **lowercase**, with spaces as underscores. With materials enabled,
the suffix is the resolved material (also lowercase).

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `dwarfipelago/craft_count/barrel_metal` | Total Metal Barrels crafted/stored (when `craftsanity_materials` is `"1"`) |
| `dwarfipelago/craft_count/barrel_wood` | Total Wooden Barrels crafted/stored (when `craftsanity_materials` is `"1"`) |
| `dwarfipelago/craft_count/barrel` | Total Barrels of any material (when `craftsanity_materials` is `"0"`) |
| `dwarfipelago/craft_count/glass` | Total Glass items (Glass has only one material type, so always stored without suffix) |


#### How a completed job becomes a flag

`checks.job_to_craft_flag(job)` (in `checks.lua`) maps a finished job to the
craft-count flag it should increment. The authoritative mapping lives in
`checks.lua` and is built from these tables — refer to the source rather than
duplicating the full list here, as it spans ~100 item types:

- **`JOB_TO_CRAFT_FLAG`** (`cmap` calls) — maps a `df.job_type` directly to a
  flag, e.g. `ConstructDoor → "door"`, `MakeCage → "cage"`,
  `ConstructBlocks → "blocks"`, `MakeCrafts → "crafts"`,
  `SmeltOre → "metal_bars"`, `MakeRawGlass → "glass"`.
- **Subtype dispatch** — some jobs resolve to a flag via the item's
  `item_subtype` using the `TOOL_SUBTYPE_FLAG`, `TRAP_SUBTYPE_FLAG`,
  `SHIELD_SUBTYPE_FLAG`, `WEAPON_SUBTYPE_FLAG`, `HELM_SUBTYPE_FLAG`,
  `GOBLET_SUBTYPE_FLAG`, `REACTION_SUBTYPE_FLAG`, `UARMOR_SUBTYPE_FLAG`,
  `GARMOR_SUBTYPE_FLAG`, and `LARMOR_SUBTYPE_FLAG` tables. For example a
  `MakeWeapon` job resolves to `"battle_axe"`, `"short_sword"`, etc. by subtype.
- **Material split** — when `craftsanity_materials` is `"1"`, a material-relevant
  item's flag gets a `_<material>` suffix (e.g. `table_wood`, `blocks_stone`).
  `mat_craft_flag(job)` resolves the material, token-first, with fallbacks so it
  works for both manual jobs and Manager work orders:
  1. decode `job.mat_type`/`job.mat_index` and match the raw token —
     `IS_METAL` flag → `metal`, `GLASS` → `glass`, `CLAY`/`KAOLINITE`/`PORCELAIN`
     → `ceramic`, `INORGANIC` → `stone`, `:WOOD` → `wood`, `LEATHER` → `leather`,
     `SILK`/`YARN` → `cloth`, `BONE` → `bone`;
  2. else read the job's `material_category` bitfield (generic "any wood/stone" jobs);
  3. else scan the job's consumed/produced **items** for a usable material
     (manual workshop jobs often leave `mat_type = -1`);
  4. last resort: builtin `mat_type` (0 → `stone`, 3–5 → `glass`).

> **Note:** the flag strings produced here must match the storage-key suffixes
> the Python client initializes in `init_crafting_locations` (derived from each
> AP location's `item`/`material`, lowercased with spaces → underscores). If a
> craft count never increments, a flag/key-name mismatch between `checks.lua`
> and the AP location data is the first thing to check.

## Python Patterns

### Pop a queue (read + clear atomically)

The existing `pop_pending_checks` in `DwarfFortressClient.py` is the reference
implementation — follow its exact pattern for `pending_item_created` and
`pending_item_stockpiled`. The inline Lua must read and clear in a single call
so no events fall through between poll cycles.

Keys to implement methods for:
- `dwarfipelago/pending_item_created` → `pop_item_created_events() -> list[dict]`
- `dwarfipelago/pending_item_stockpiled` → `pop_stockpile_events() -> list[dict]`

Call both inside the poll loop alongside `_process_new_checks()`.

### Peek at any key (read without clearing)

Use `run_command("lua", ...)` with `dfhack.persistent.getWorldDataString` and
`print()` to read a key without touching it. Useful for debugging — return the
stripped output string.

### Write config to Lua

JSON sent through the inline Lua string must have its double-quotes escaped
before embedding. Look at how `_sync_slot_data` writes the goal/wealth/pop
values — any JSON config follows the same approach.

---

## Lua Module Reference

Modules live under `mods/dwarfipelago/scripts_modinstalled/internal/dwarfipelago/`.
Load them from Python via `reqscript("internal/dwarfipelago/<module>")`.

### `checks`

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `checks` | table | List of all static AP location check definitions |
| `production_flag(flag)` | fn → bool | True if a first-production flag has fired |
| `set_production_flag(flag)` | fn | Mark a first-production flag |
| `trade_flag(flag)` | fn → bool | True if a trade/caravan flag has fired |
| `set_trade_flag(flag)` | fn | Mark a trade flag |
| `job_to_production_flag(job)` | fn → string\|nil | Maps a completed job to its first-production flag |
| `job_to_craft_flag(job)` | fn → string\|nil | Maps a completed job to its craft-count flag |
| `increment_craft_count(flag)` | fn → int | Increment and persist a craft count (also records the flag in the craft index), returns new total |
| `get_craft_count(flag)` | fn → int | Read current craft count for a flag |
| `get_all_craft_counts()` | fn → table | `{flag = count}` for every flag in the craft index with count > 0 (used by `status`) |
| `clear_craft_counts()` | fn | Wipe all recorded craft counts and the index (used by `reset`) |
| `fortress_wealth()` | fn → int | Current total fortress wealth (items + buildings + stocks) |
| `treasury_wealth()` | fn → int | Combined value of minted coins + cut gems in stocks (used by the legendary_wealth goal and wealth-tier checks) |

### `state`

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `is_enabled()` | fn → bool | Whether the mod is active |
| `mark_location_checked(id)` | fn → bool | Mark a location as checked; returns true if newly checked |
| `is_location_checked(id)` | fn → bool | Check if a location ID has already been checked |
| `increment_death_count()` | fn → int | Increment citizen death counter |
| `get_death_count()` | fn → int | Read citizen death counter |
| `get_deathlinks_sent()` | fn → int | Read DeathLinks-sent counter |
| `get_pending_recv()` | fn → int | Read pending incoming DeathLinks |
| `is_goal_complete()` | fn → bool | True if fortress has won |
| `mark_goal_complete()` | fn → bool | Set goal complete; returns true if first time |
| `dump()` | fn | Print full state summary to DFHack console |
| `reset()` | fn | Wipe all persistent state (use with care) |

### `log`

Levelled logging that writes to a file **and** mirrors to the DFHack console.
The log file lives next to the DF executable: `<Dwarf Fortress>/dwarfipelago.log`
(auto-rotated at 1 MB, keeping one `.old` backup). The exact path is printed to
the console when the mod starts.

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `info(msg)` | fn | Log at INFO; mirrors to console via `print` |
| `warn(msg)` | fn | Log at WARN; mirrors to console via `printerr` |
| `error(msg)` | fn | Log at ERROR; mirrors to console via `printerr` |
| `path()` | fn → string | Absolute path to the active log file |

---

## In-Game Panel (`dwarfipelago-panel.lua`)

The in-game status and control panel lives in:
```
mods/dwarfipelago/scripts_modinstalled/dwarfipelago-panel.lua
```

It is a DFHack overlay widget + ZScreen popup. Open it three ways:
- Click the `[AP]` button in the top-left corner of the fortress screen
- Run `dwarfipelago panel` from the DFHack console
- Run `dwarfipelago-panel` directly from the DFHack console

The popup is a resizable `widgets.Window` containing a `widgets.TabBar` + `widgets.Pages`,
each page a `widgets.Panel`. The tabs are `{"Status", "Unlocks", "Progress", "Crafts", "Controls", "Energy"}`:

| Tab | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| **Status** | enabled state, goal, completion, depot status |
| **Unlocks** | progression unlock counts/flags — **built dynamically** from `items.UNLOCK_DEFS` |
| **Progress** | goal progress (wealth/population/remains toward target) |
| **Crafts** | craftsanity craft counts and craftlock/permit status |
| **Controls** | Restart/Start (`Shift+S`), Reset all AP state (`Shift+R`), Reset seed (`Shift+D`) |
| **Energy** | Energy Link pool balance (MJ + raw kJ), Deposit Ale/Food/Coins, and call-a-caravan (only meaningful when `energy_enabled` is `"1"`) |

`open_panel()` toggles: calling it again while open dismisses the existing instance.

### Adding a status field

Add a `widgets.Label` to the **Status** page's `subviews` (Tab 1 in `pages`), with
`frame = {t=N, l=0}` where `t` is the row within that page. Read plain persistent
keys with the local `ps(key, default)` helper; read the enabled flag via
`state.is_enabled()` (it's stored as a JSON object, not a plain string). Use the
`yn(bool [,yes_color, no_color])` helper for YES/no values.

### Adding a progression unlock

You usually **don't** edit the panel — add an entry to `items.UNLOCK_DEFS` (in
`items.lua`) with `{ key, label, max? }` and it appears on the Unlocks tab
automatically (and in `dwarfipelago status`).

### Adding a control button

Add a `widgets.HotkeyLabel` to the **Controls** page's `subviews` (Tab 3):
```lua
widgets.HotkeyLabel{
    frame = {t=5, l=2},           -- next free row under the existing controls
    key   = "CUSTOM_SHIFT_X",     -- DFHack key binding name
    label = "My action",
    on_activate = function()
        dfhack.run_command("dwarfipelago", "some-subcommand")
        self:dismiss()
    end,
},
```

Available `CUSTOM_SHIFT_*` keys: A–Z. Taken: **S** (Restart/Start), **R** (Reset), **D** (Reset seed).

### Moving the `[AP]` hotspot button

The corner button position is set in `DwarfipelagoHotspot.ATTRS`:
```lua
default_pos = {x=6, y=2},   -- x= column from left, y= row from top (1-indexed)
```

Negative values count from the bottom-right edge (e.g. `{x=-5, y=-2}`).
The position only takes effect on first load — if DFHack has already saved a position for this widget, edit `dfhack-config/overlay.json` in your DF install and remove the `dwarfipelago-panel.hotspot` entry to reset it.
